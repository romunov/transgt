Description: Classical capillary genotyping results in different laboratories yielding relatively
  different absolute values of genotypes. As alleles are called based on the speed of travelled DNA
  particles, this can vary from one machine to another. Assuming you have reference sampled in a 
  reference laboratory, you can construct a translation table. For well behaved loci, you can translate
  by substracting or adding to the length of DNA fragments, but some loci may be more problematic. In
  that case, you will need to map a specific translation value for each allele. This package supports
  translation of both of those cases.
